# Welcome to Gurobi's public GitHub projects!

Our projects use the [Apache-2.0 license](../LICENSE) and we follow our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a welcoming and open culture for everyone involved.

## Questions, Issues, and Contributions

We use our [Gurobi Community Forum](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/community/topics) to organize discussions around the projects so please feel free to write a new post if anything is unclear or if you have a specific question.

Technical issues are best reported and handled as GitHub issues in the respective projects. The same holds for contributions that are supposed to be made by creating new Pull Requests in the projects.

We hope to grow and establish a collaborative community around Gurobi by openly developing a variety of different projects and tools that make optimization more accessible and easier to use for everyone.

For further information please refer to the individual README files of the respective projects.
